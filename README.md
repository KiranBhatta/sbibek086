### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I tried a lot to be proficient natives on PHP, React & what not! But finally I confess that developer coding is not that much in my genes, I leave it to born gifted people for that though I occasionally find myself trying on it. So, I switched to AwS Cloud Solutions Architect as it's little lesser about coding & more about system understanding design.   BUT I am GITHUB ENTHUSIASTIC & HARDCORE MAXIMALIST because of its versatility and supersized features.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://www.linkedin.com/in/sbibek086
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning, what you can see on issues on https://github.com/sbibek086/Git-and-Github-Guides & https://github.com/sbibek086/DockerKubernetes.CodeSnippets.DevResourceServerLinks. I know journalling on issues is not the standard way as I m in lack of proper better way. Suggest me!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on https://github.com/sbibek086/PR-accepted-Posts
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with How to collaborate create github page Wiki like community does synergetically- in this case just compiling useful links as this project https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books 

I am in GMT +5:45 Timezone. I use Google Calendar and http://worldchatclock.com/
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything that you find useful in my repo.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://meet.google.com/coh-bapv-fqx or if for mutual remote control of PC - anydesk: 673072513

- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that this profile ReadMe was created just creating new public repository with the name same as my github handle- in my case sbibek086 as seen in github.com/sbibek086 ,and all this was written in READE.md
- âš¡ Fun fact: In google calendar, there's a time zone trick. From your main calendar page, hit the â€˜sâ€™ key to enter settings and youâ€™ll see an option to set your time zone along with an additional time zone. You can add any time zone you need there. So now your calendar will show the time of day along with the corresponding times for a second time zone.
