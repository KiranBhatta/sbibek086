### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I tried a lot to be proficient natives on PHP, React & what not! But finally I confess that developer coding is not that much in my genes, I leave it to born gifted people for that though I occasionally find myself trying on it. So, I switched to AwS Cloud Solutions Architect as it's little lesser about coding & more about system understanding design.   BUT I am GITHUB ENTHUSIASTIC & HARDCORE MAXIMALIST because of its versatility and supersized features.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://www.linkedin.com/in/sbibek086
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning, what you can see on issues on https://github.com/sbibek086/Git-and-Github-Guides & https://github.com/sbibek086/DockerKubernetes.CodeSnippets.DevResourceServerLinks. I know journalling on issues is not the standard way as I m in lack of proper better way. Suggest me!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on https://sbibek086.github.io/write-the-docs/ . THIS IS MY OFFICIAL WEBSITE / BLOG also.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with How to collaborate create github page Wiki like community does synergetically- in this case just compiling useful links as this project https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books 

I am in GMT +5:45 Timezone. I use Google Calendar and http://worldchatclock.com/

- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that this profile ReadMe was created just creating new public repository with the name same as my github handle- in my case sbibek086 as seen in github.com/sbibek086 ,and all this was written in READE.md
- âš¡ Fun fact: In google calendar, there's a time zone trick. From your main calendar page, hit the â€˜sâ€™ key to enter settings and youâ€™ll see an option to set your time zone along with an additional time zone. You can add any time zone you need there. So now your calendar will show the time of day along with the corresponding times for a second time zone.  
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that if you want to share some random ideas or codes on the fly without having to create repo etc but still be able to share, fork, PR, then gists.github.com, add some codesnippets/ideas, THEN ADD FILES button at left bottom to add another gists. 
   Mine is https://gists.github.com/sbibek086. I personally use it to day journalling or VOILA-I-understood-that-Let-me-note moment. Just personal uncooked posts.
